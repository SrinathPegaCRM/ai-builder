# AI Builder licensing

AI Builder is licensed as an add-on to your Power Apps, Power Automate, or Dynamics 365 license. This means you can start your AI Builder trial after you have a Power Apps, Power Automate, or Dynamics 365 license that allows you to create a Common Data Service environment.

For detailed information about AI Builder licensing:

- [Microsoft Power Apps and Power Automate Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2085130)<!--I don't think you want the locale identifier? -->
- [AI Builder licensing FAQ](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#ai-builder)

## Preview features and trial licenses

Want to get started using AI Builder? Use premium features for a limited time with a trial license, or use preview features without obtaining a license at all.

### Preview features

AI Builder features that are in preview release status are free to use. You don't need to obtain a license to use AI Builder preview features.

### Trial licenses

An AI Builder trial license enables you to use AI Builder for free for the duration of the trial period.

What you get with an AI Builder trial license:

- Create and use AI models in any environment (trial or production), because the AI Builder trial license is applicable at the user level, not environment level.
- Store your AI model results in Common Data Service.
- Use AI model results in your apps, flows, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> Your trial license is specific to a user, not an environment. If you already have an environment with a Power Apps license (free or paid), you can use that environment or create a new one for your AI Builder trial.

For more information about trial licenses, see the following:

- [Power Apps](https://signup.microsoft.com/Start?sku=powerapps)
- [Power Automate](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/)

### After the trial expires

Trial environments expire after 30 days, but the trial period can be extended.<!--Can you say how?-->
After<!--Via Writing Style Guide.--> you purchase an AI Builder license, your usage will be limited to environments where the administrator allocates AI capacity.

> [!NOTE]
> These restrictions apply only to model types that have been released to general availability. Model types in preview release status will remain available without a license until they're released for general availability.

## Paid licenses and capacity allocation

First, you have to purchase AI Builder capacity add-on for your Power Apps or Power Automate licenses. Then an administrator has to allocate that capacity to any Power Apps environment where you want to use AI Builder.

- An administrator has to assign AI Builder capacity to any environment where you want to use AI Builder.
- You can't create or modify AI Builder models, and no new inference will be possible when the trial expires if you don't purchase a license.

### Allocate AI Builder capacity

Because AI Builder is licensed as a capacity add-on to your existing Power Apps and Power Automate licenses, an administrator has to allocate capacity for AI Builder to the environment before you can use it. Information about how to allocate capacity in the Power Platform admin center is available in [Capacity add-ons](/power-platform/admin/capacity-add-on).
