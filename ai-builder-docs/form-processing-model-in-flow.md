# Use a form-processing model in Power Automate

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > To use AI Builder models in Power Automate, you have to create the flow inside a solution. The steps below won't work if you don't follow these instructions first: [Create a flow in a solution](/flow/create-flow-solution).


1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/), select the **My flows** tab, and then select **New > +Instant-from blank**.
1. Name your flow, select **Manually trigger a flow** under **Choose how to trigger this flow**, and then select **Create**.
1. Expand **Manually trigger a flow**, select **+Add an input**, select **File** as the input type, and set as input title **File Content**.
1. Select **+ New step**, search for **AI Builder** in the Search for filters and actions box, and then select **Process and save information from forms** in the list of actions.
1.	Select the form processing model you want to use, select the Document type, and in the **Document** field add **File Content** from the trigger:

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select file content](media/flow-select-file-content-2.png "Select file content")

1. In the successive actions, you can use any fields and tables extracted by the AI Builder model. For example, let's say that our model is trained to extract the *Invoice Id* and the *Total Amount* value, and we want to post those to a Microsoft Teams channel. Just add the **Post a message to Teams** action, and then select your fields from the list of tokens.

    > [!NOTE]
    >- To retreive the value for a field, select **<field_name> value** . For example, for the *INVOICE* field, select **INVOICE value**.
    >- To retrieve the confidence score for a field, select **<field_name> confidence score** . For example, for the *INVOICE* field, select **INVOICE confidence score**.
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

## Parameters
### Input
|Name |Required |Type |Description |Values |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|**AI Model** |Yes |model |Form processing model to use for analysis|Trained and published form processing models |
|**Document type** |Yes |list |The file type of the form to analyze|PDF Document (.pdf), JPEG Image (.jpeg), PNG Image (.png) |
|**Form** |Yes |file |Form to process| |


### Output
|Name |Type |Description |Values |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|**{field} value** |string |The value extracted by the AI model| |
|**{field} confidence score** |float |How confident the model is in its prediction |Value in the range of 0 to 1. Values close to 1 indicate greater confidence that the extracted value is accurate |
|**{table}{column} value** |string |The value extracted by the AI model for a cell in a table| |
|**{table}{column} confidence score** |float |How confident the model is in its prediction |Value in the range of 0 to 1. Values close to 1 indicate greater confidence that the extracted cell value is accurate |

**Note:** More output parameters may be proposed such as field coordinates, polygons, bounding boxes and page numbers. These are not listed on purpose as mainly intended to advanced usage.
