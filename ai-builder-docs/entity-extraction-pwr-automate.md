# Use an entity extraction custom model in Power Automate (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
 > To use AI Builder models in Power Automate, you have to create the flow inside a solution. The steps below won't work if you don't follow these instructions first: [Create a flow in a solution](/flow/create-flow-solution).

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/), select the **My flows** tab, and then select **Automated-from blank**.

1. Search for the term **email**, select **When an email arrives (V3)** in the list of triggers, and then select  **Create**.

1. Select **+ New step**, search for the term **html to text**, and then select **Html to text** in the list of actions.

1. Select the **Body** parameter. This tells the entity extraction model to only analyze actual email text.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select Html to text](media/html-to-text.png "Select Html to text")

1. Select **+ New step**, search for **predict**, and then select the **Predict Common Data Service (current Environment)** action.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select Predict Common Data Service](media/predict-cds-2.png "Select Predict Common Data Service")

1. Select your published custom entity extraction model.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Extract entities screen](media/flow-extract-entity.png "Extract entities screen")

1. Select **+ New step**, search for **Add a row into a table**, and then select the **Add a row into a table** action.

1. Complete the necessary fields to find the location of your Excel table. Make sure you created a table and designated columns where you want to store the results of entity extraction. Find the results of entity extraction in the available dynamic content such as **Entity type** and **Entity value**, as shown in the following image.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Add a row into a table'](media/flow-add-row2.png "Add a row into a table")

Congratulations! You've created a flow that uses an entity extraction model. Select **Save** in the upper-right corner, and then select **Test** to try out your flow.
