# Use a category classification custom model in Power Automate (preview)
<!--Okay to add "preview"?-->
[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
 > To use AI Builder models in Power Automate, you have to create the flow inside a solution. The steps below won't work if you don't follow these instructions first: [Create a flow in a solution](/flow/create-flow-solution).

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/), select the **My flows** tab, and then select **Create from blank**.

1. Search for **manually**, select **Manually trigger a flow** in the list of triggers, and then select **+Add an input**.

1. Select **Text**, and enter **My Text** as the input title.
1. Select **+ New step**, search for **Predict**, and then select **Predict Common Data Service (current Environment)** in the list of actions.
    >[!NOTE]
    > **Predict Common Data Service (current Environment)** doesn't appear unless you've followed these instructions first: [Create a flow in a solution](/flow/create-flow-solution).

1. Select the category classification model you want to use, and then do the following:

   - In the **Text** field, add **My Text** from the trigger.
   - In the **Language** field, select the two-letter language code for the supported language you want to use.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
      > ![Trigger a flow screen](media/trigger-flow.png "Trigger a flow screen")

1. In your flow's successive actions, you can iterate through the outputs returned by the category classification model. In the following example, the model saves each inferred tag into a SharePoint list.<!--Can you add what's going on here to the alt text? Information should never be carried only in images, there needs to be a text explanation too.-->

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Trigger a flow example](media/trigger-flow-example.png "Trigger a flow example")

Congratulations! You've created a flow that uses a category classification AI Builder model. Select **Save** in the upper-right corner, and then select **Test** to try out your flow.

To learn more about triggers and actions, see [Get started with Power Automate](/flow/getting-started).
