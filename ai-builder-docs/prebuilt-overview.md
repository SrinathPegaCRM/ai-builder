# Overview of prebuilt AI models
<!--Please note that in the actual articles, the H1s are slightly dissimilar: most of them are simply "<NameOfModel> model", but category classification and entity extraction are "<NameOfModel> prebuilt model." I see why it's that way, but maybe they should all be "<NameOfModel> prebuilt model"? especially if someday one of these other ones might become a custom model and need to be distinguished from its prebuilt version.-->
AI Builder prebuilt models help you add intelligence to apps and flows without having to gather data and then build, train, and publish your own models. For example, in Power Apps you can add a component based on a prebuilt model that recognizes contact information from business cards. You can use a prebuilt model in Power Automate to analyze whether customer feedback was positive or negative.

Prebuilt models are available in Power Automate and&mdash;depending on the model&mdash; in Power Apps. The following prebuilt models are currently available in AI Builder.
<!--Edits to the table okay? I rearranged rows to echo the order in the TOC and added "Category classification."-->
