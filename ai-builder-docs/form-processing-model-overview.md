# Overview of the form-processing model

You can use AI Builder form processing to create AI models that use machine learning technology to identify and extract key-value pairs and table data from form documents.

[Train](train-model.md) your model and define the information to be extracted from your forms. You only need five form documents to get started. Quickly get accurate results tailored to your specific content. With AI Builder, you don't need a lot of manual intervention or data science expertise.

After you train and [publish](publish-model.md) your model, you can use it in the AI Builder [form-processor component](form-processor-component-in-powerapps.md) in a Power Apps canvas app or in [Power Automate](form-processing-model-in-flow.md).
